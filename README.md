# CloudNet Transformer

Simply update CloudNet 2 to CloudNet 3 and CloudNet 3 down to CloudNet 2

# Usage
Download the latest CloudNetTransformer.jar from the [releases page](https://github.com/derrop/CloudNetTransformer/releases/latest) and
execute it by using the following command: `java -jar CloudNetTransformer.jar`. 
 
Now just answer the questions and it will automatically convert your selected installation into the directory where the transformer 
is running (e.g. `./CloudNet_2` for a transformation to CloudNet 2). It will also automatically download the required start file
for your new installation, you just have to execute it (for CloudNet 2 there are two start files, CloudNet-Master and CloudNet-Wrapper,
both need to be executed).
